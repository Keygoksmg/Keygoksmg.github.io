## Acknowledgement network
<img src="project_acknow.png" width="500">
The research in the academic world represents scientists’ human relationships, and it significantly contributes to innovations and acceleration of science. However, there are many contributed intercommunications which are neither citation nor collaboration relationships. Here, we take into account them by applying acknowledgement description, and seek new insight into scientists’ world, establishing and understanding the network based on the acknowledgement relationships.
