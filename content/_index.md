I'm a master student at the University of Tsukuba, Japan. Currently, I am studying with [Dr Yukie Sano](https://sites.google.com/view/sanolabo-en/home) at the Department of Systems and Information Engineering. My research interests lie in network science, Science of Science, multilayer networks and computational social science.

I earned B.S. in Policy and Planning Science at University of Tsukuba, Japan. When I was an undergrad, I had an opportunity to study at Guadalajara, Mexico, for 1 year as an exchange student. I like playing/watching football :soccer:, surfing :surfer:, and eating Los tacos in private.
