I'm a master student at the University of Tsukuba, Japan. Currently, I am studying under the supervision of [Dr Yukie Sano](https://sites.google.com/view/sanolabo-en/home). at the Department of Systems and Information Engineering. My research interests lie in network science, Science of Science, and computational social science. In recent work, I've been building and analysing scholarly communication in view of the acknowledgement statement in academic articles. 

I earned B.S. in Policy and Planning Science at University of Tsukuba, Japan. When I was an undergrad, I had an opportunity to study at Guadalajara, Mexico, for 1 year as an exchange student. I like playing/watching football :soccer:, surfing :surfer:, and eating Los tacos in private.
